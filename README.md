# Angular Elements Test

Example project to demonstrate needed setup for creating Angular Elements.

This particular setup is based on [this](https://codingthesmartway.com/angular-elements-a-practical-introduction-to-web-components-with-angular-6/) tutorial, which uses [fs-extra](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fs-extra) and [concat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concat) modules to create the final built ```dist```.
